- How is the "at-risk" (denominator) population defined for each ufald?
Specifically: + If someone moves to DK in February of year X and gets a
diagnosis, would they be included in the denominator for the prevalent
population for year X? Would they be included in the incident cases for year X?



- Which patient types (pattypes) are included when including ambulant patients
(0,1,2,3)?

- "To ensure a minimum 10-year hospital history, the Danish Heart Statistics
provides statistics on cardiovascular variables from 2006 onwards". How does
this work for the outcomes that use a 3-year moving avg? In 2006, this would
require data from 10 years before 2004; however emergency room and outpatient
data only starts in 1995

- Which causes of death were used when calculating how many died from a specific
illness? Fx, do you count a death when the disease is listed among any of the
immediate, following, underlying and supplementary causes of death (umiddelbar,
f√∏lgende, tilgrundliggende, supplerende)? This corresponds to variables (see
